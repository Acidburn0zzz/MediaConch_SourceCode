Version 15.12, 2015-12-31

Database support (speed improvement: file is parsed once, then policies are applied to the pre-analyzed content)
More explicit licences (MediaConch and MediaInfo library are GPLv3+ and MPLv2+, list of third party libraries and their licences)
Matroska: negative timecodes were not correctly handled
Better support of non-English filenames
Display format is applied also on invalid files
Implementation tests now load logic from an XML representation of the Matroska EBML Schema
Implementation tests on valid parent elements, element multiplicity, mandated child elements
MediaTrace now documents the parser used for raw streams within Matroska.
Sync tests with latest Matroska/EBML draft specifications.

Documentation update
Support of MKVMerge statistics tags (duration frame count, stream size, bit rate) per track
Count of subtitle elements
Frame rate detection algorithm revisited
Showing precision of 1/1.001 frame rates (e.g. "23.976 (24000/1001) fps" and "23.976 (23976/1000) fps")

Version 15.10, 2015-11-02
